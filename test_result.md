# THIS SECTION CONTAINS CRITICAL TESTING INSTRUCTIONS FOR BOTH AGENTS
# BOTH MAIN_AGENT AND TESTING_AGENT MUST PRESERVE THIS ENTIRE BLOCK

# Communication Protocol:
# If the `testing_agent` is available, main agent should delegate all testing tasks to it.
#
# You have access to a file called `test_result.md`. This file contains the complete testing state
# and history, and is the primary means of communication between main and the testing agent.
#
# Main and testing agents must follow this exact format to maintain testing data. 
# The testing data must be entered in yaml format Below is the data structure:
# 
## user_problem_statement: {problem_statement}
## backend:
##   - task: "Task name"
##     implemented: true
##     working: true  # or false or "NA"
##     file: "file_path.py"
##     stuck_count: 0
##     priority: "high"  # or "medium" or "low"
##     needs_retesting: false
##     status_history:
##         -working: true  # or false or "NA"
##         -agent: "main"  # or "testing" or "user"
##         -comment: "Detailed comment about status"
##
## frontend:
##   - task: "Task name"
##     implemented: true
##     working: true  # or false or "NA"
##     file: "file_path.js"
##     stuck_count: 0
##     priority: "high"  # or "medium" or "low"
##     needs_retesting: false
##     status_history:
##         -working: true  # or false or "NA"

##   run_ui: false
##
## test_plan:
##   current_focus:
##     - "Task name 1"
##     - "Task name 2"
##   stuck_tasks:
##     - "Task name with persistent issues"
##   test_all: false

##
## agent_communication:
##     -agent: "main"  # or "testing" or "user"
##     -message: "Communication message between agents"

# Protocol Guidelines for Main agent
#
# 1. Update Test Result File Before Testing:
#    - Main agent must always update the `test_result.md` file before calling the testing agent
#    - Add implementation details to the status_history
#    - Set `needs_retesting` to true for tasks that need testing
#    - Update the `test_plan` section to guide testing priorities
#    - Add a message to `agent_communication` explaining what you've done
#
# 2. Incorporate User Feedback:
#    - When a user provides feedback that something is or isn't working, add this information to the relevant task's status_history
#    - Update the working status based on user feedback
#    - If a user reports an issue with a task that was marked as working, increment the stuck_count
#    - Whenever user reports issue in the app, if we have testing agent and task_result.md file so find the appropriate task for that and append in status_history of that task to contain the user concern and problem as well 
#
# 3. Track Stuck Tasks:
#    - Monitor which tasks have high stuck_count values or where you are fixing same issue again and again, analyze that when you read task_result.md
#    - For persistent issues, use websearch tool to find solutions
#    - Pay special attention to tasks in the stuck_tasks list
#    - When you fix an issue with a stuck task, don't reset the stuck_count until the testing agent confirms it's working
#
# 4. Provide Context to Testing Agent:
#    - When calling the testing agent, provide clear instructions about:
#      - Which tasks need testing (reference the test_plan)
#      - Any authentication details or configuration needed
#      - Specific test scenarios to focus on
#      - Any known issues or edge cases to verify
#
# 5. Call the testing agent with specific instructions referring to test_result.md
#
# IMPORTANT: Main agent must ALWAYS update test_result.md BEFORE calling the testing agent, as it relies on this file to understand what to test next.

Basic CRUD works (77.8% test success) but NO automatic progress calculation between goals and health entries. Analytics endpoint (/api/health/analytics) only provides basic counts (meals, workouts) without goal correlation. Goals have no progress tracking mechanism.

COMPREHENSIVE TESTING RESULTS: 1) Hydration logging: 'glass of water'=250ml, 'bottle'=500ml, '2 cups'=400ml - all correctly processed and accumulated (0→1650ml). 2) Meal logging: LLM accurately estimates calories/protein for pasta(500cal/13g), sandwich(350cal/17g), burger(600cal/27g), chicken+rice(500cal/30g) - totaling 1950cal/87g protein. 3) Sleep logging: Processes '8 hours', 'slept 10pm-6am'=8hrs, '7.5 hours' correctly (final: 7.5hrs as expected for replacement not increment). 4) Data validation: Hydration properly capped, confidence scoring >0.6 working. 5) Daily stats endpoints: GET /api/health/stats/{session_id} and POST /api/health/stats/reset/{session_id} both functional. 6) Donna's health confirmations: Personalized, encouraging messages with proper emojis. 7) Non-health messages handled normally without false positives.

Added checkAndPerformDailyReset() function that: 1) Checks current local time and date 2) Compares with existing health stats date 3) Triggers reset if past 6 AM and stats are from previous day 4) Preserves historical data while creating fresh daily stats. Integrated into loadDailyHealthStats() for on-demand reset. Completely invisible to users - they just see clean stats for new day. Uses backend reset endpoint to ensure data consistency."

        comment: "✅ WEEKLY HEALTH ANALYTICS FULLY FUNCTIONAL: Comprehensive testing shows 100% success rate (66/66 tests passed). ENDPOINT TESTING: GET /api/health/analytics/weekly/{session_id} returns complete WeeklyHealthAnalytics model with all required fields (averages, targets, patterns, expert analysis). Week offset functionality working (current week, last week, future weeks). POST /api/health/analytics/weekly/regenerate/{session_id} successfully deletes existing analytics and generates fresh ones. LLM EXPERT ANALYSIS: Harvard-level sophisticated analysis generated for all categories (calories, protein, hydration, sleep) with metabolic terminology (hormonal, physiological, biochemical, circadian). Both detailed expert analysis (400-600 chars) and compact insights (150-200 chars) generated. Overall integrative analysis shows cross-system interactions. DATA PROCESSING: Weekly aggregation across 7 days working correctly with proper average calculations. Pattern detection algorithms functional (consistency scoring, trend analysis, weekday vs weekend patterns). Target integration from health_targets collection working perfectly - custom targets override defaults. INTEGRATION: New health entries via chat affect weekly analytics when regenerated. Session-based data isolation confirmed. Error handling robust for invalid sessions, extreme week offsets, and edge cases. Caching behavior optimal. Feature provides genuinely useful insights users couldn't get elsewhere."

    message: "🏥 HEALTH GOALS BACKEND ANALYSIS COMPLETE: Found critical issues affecting stat card updates. Backend health endpoints work (POST/GET /api/health/goals, POST/GET /api/health/entries, GET /api/health/analytics) but MISSING KEY FUNCTIONALITY: 1) No automatic progress calculation between goals and entries, 2) No goal-related data in analytics endpoint, 3) Goals have no progress tracking mechanism. Analytics only shows basic counts (meals, workouts) but doesn't correlate with user goals. This explains why stat cards don't update when goals are set - there's no backend logic connecting goals to progress tracking. Need goal-specific analytics endpoints and automatic progress calculation algorithms."
