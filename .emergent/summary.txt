The trajectory details the AI engineer's work on the Donna application, focusing on two main feature areas: the Career tab and the Health tab.

Initially, the AI engineer addressed a critical bug in the Career tab: the Generate plan button was not functioning. This involved fixing frontend logic in  to correctly call the backend API for career goal creation and action plan generation. Significant effort was then directed towards enhancing the Career tab's user experience, including adding loading states, populating resource cards (AI tools, books, talks) based on goal categories, and iteratively refining the layout and styling of these resources for responsiveness and aesthetic appeal (e.g., distributing resources left/right, preventing overflow).

A major part of the Career tab's development involved designing an intuitive onboarding experience. This evolved from large sample goal pods to smaller, horizontal, subtly colored pills, eventually transitioning to a pre-generated sample action plan with a clear explanatory message. This was followed by implementing a Reset Career Goals button and refining the sample plan's content and format to include Donna's signature Insight lines.

Subsequently, the focus shifted entirely to the new Health tab. The AI engineer started by clearing its existing content and then implemented four primary stat cards (Calories, Protein, Hydration, Sleep) with sophisticated circular progress indicators, following a user-provided design reference. This involved extensive CSS work and state management. After resolving a compilation error, the logging section for Sleep, Meals, and Hydration was redesigned to be sleek, card-less, and user-friendly, with custom icons and elegant, subtle glassmorphic styling, which is the current state of work. The engineer is refining the colors and spacing of the logging inputs.

<product_requirements>
The Donna application is a futuristic, glassmorphic AI assistant calendar app.
**Calendar Tab:** Features include event management (delete, complete, notes, consistency), timezone awareness, telemetry, and UI/UX enhancements (monthly view, smart suggestion refinement, mobile-optimized card display).
**Career Tab:** A sophisticated, dark corporate pitch deck aesthetic.
    -   **Goal Bar:** Slim, 3D glassmorphic pill for goal input with a distinct Generate plan button.
    -   **Action Plan:** Professional vertical timeline with Montserrat font, each step includes an instruction and a clever insight generated by Donna, categorized by goal type (Career Growth, Business Expansion, Job Seeking).
    -   **Resource Display:** Three elegant, rotating circular elements (AI Tools, Books, Talks/Videos) displaying sample options in glassmorphic pills. Resources should be functional (links open in new tabs for AI tools/talks), categorize dynamically by user goal, and be laid out efficiently (left/right of circles, no horizontal scroll).
    -   **Onboarding:** Initial experience showing either sample goal pills (horizontal, subtle colors, enticing) or a pre-generated sample action plan with a clear message that it's a demo, to encourage user interaction.
    -   **Reset Feature:** A small, unobtrusive â†» Start Fresh button to clear career goals.
**Health Tab:** A futuristic, museum-worthy, glassmorphic design.
    -   **Stat Displays:** Four sleek, modern stat displays side-by-side (responsive) for Calories, Protein, Hydration, Sleep. Each card shows current value vs. goal with a sophisticated circular progress indicator (segmented bar style, subtle gradients, clean center text, consistent color per stat).
    -   **Logging Section:** Below stats.
        -   **Log Meals:** Natural inputs (e.g., bowl of salad) to auto-approximate calories/protein.
        -   **Log Hydration:** + Glass (250ml), + Bottle (500ml) buttons, or custom ml input.
        -   **Log Sleep:** Slept at: and Woke up at: time inputs for Donna to calculate hours accurately.
    -   **Goal Setting:** A Set Goal button that opens an empty glassmorphic modal.
    -   **Overall Aesthetic:** Sleek, minimal colors, consistent fonts, no emojis, responsive, stat cards prioritized. Logging sections should be sleek, compact, and card-less, with custom icons and elegant 3D glassmorphic input fields with subtle glows and borders.

<current_work>
The AI engineer is currently refining the visual design of the logging section within the newly developed Health tab. Specifically, the task at hand is to tone down the colors for the Log Meals and Log Hydration sections, as the user found them too loud and mismatched with Donna's sophisticated aesthetic. This involves adjusting the gradient colors and potentially the border/glow effects to be more subtle and elegant, consistent with the existing sleek, glassmorphic design language of the application. Additionally, the user requested an increase in the vertical spacing between Log Meal and Log Hydration sections to ensure equal vertical distance between all three logging sections (Sleep, Meals, Hydration), improving visual precision and balance. The last action was to edit  to refine colors and spacing.
