The AI engineer's work primarily focused on refining the Donna application's UI/UX, fixing critical bugs, and implementing new features. The trajectory began with bug fixes for the authentication modal's positioning, transitioning to a full re-evaluation and simplification of the authentication system to Google OAuth only, after encountering persistent issues with manual signup. Significant effort was then dedicated to extensive UI/UX polish across the app, including input field styling, button aesthetics, chat alignment, and responsive design for mobile. Critical functional bugs were addressed in chat response display, LLM context continuity, and calendar event loading, with a recurring theme of debugging frontend state management and API call issues. The most recent work was diagnosing and fixing an issue where calendar events were not loading in the frontend due to a double API prefix in the URL.

<product_requirements>
The Donna application is an AI assistant for health, career, and calendar management, designed with an emphasis on a sophisticated, user-friendly, and highly functional experience. The core UI features a glowing blue orb as Donna's symbol, a glassmorphic design, and a single-screen view for first-time users with interactive example cards and a prominent input bar. Health tracking includes flexible sleep logging. Gift planning was intended to create calendar events and suggest gifts, but this feature implementation was lost. Web Push Notifications are for calendar reminders and health reports. User authentication was initially implemented with Google sign-in via Emergent and manual username/password, with data isolation. After iterative fixes, authentication was simplified to Google OAuth only. The UI/UX was extensively refined, including modal positioning, chat isolation, login indicators, and the visual appearance of the chat input and example cards, to be mobile-first and intuitive.

<key_technical_concepts>
-   **Full-stack Development**: React 19 (frontend), FastAPI (backend), MongoDB.
-   **LLM Integration**: For health parsing, gift detection, and creative suggestions (e.g., LiteLLM).
-   **UI/UX Design**: Glassmorphism, SVG animations, responsive design, Radix UI dialog.
-   **User Authentication**: Emergent OAuth (Google), JWT-based sessions, data isolation, bcrypt for password hashing (initially).
-   **Web Push Notifications**: Service Workers () for phone notifications (removed from frontend).
-   **CORS**: Cross-Origin Resource Sharing configuration in FastAPI.

<code_architecture>


-   **/app/backend/server.py**:
    -   **Importance**: Core FastAPI application for API, MongoDB, and LLM orchestration.
    -   **Changes Made**:
        -   **Web Push Notifications**: VAPID keys were generated and added to .
        -   **User Authentication**: Initially added , ,  models, password hashing, and ,  endpoints. Later, the manual auth backend was simplified to use  as the primary identifier (username removed) but eventually deprecated as manual signup was removed.  was updated to allow specific origins for  to fix CORS errors. LLM prompt for calendar event creation was adjusted to be proactive, and the  was modified to remove the hardcoded instruction to ask for reminders.  was added to  creation in .
-   **/app/frontend/src/App.js**:
    -   **Importance**: Main React component managing state, API calls, and UI rendering.
    -   **Changes Made**:
        -   **Auth**:  was modified to clear preview data (messages, events, health stats, message count, local storage items) on login. Missing  function was added. The logic for displaying chat history () was dependent on proper state management. Message sending () was updated to correctly add user and Donna messages to the local state.  and  were initially called multiple times (causing race conditions/overwrites) which was addressed.  was connected to  to trigger on mount for debugging. The  API call URL was fixed by removing a double  prefix.
        -   **UI/UX**:  was initially rendered, then refined for responsive positioning (e.g., ). Login indicator (initials circle) was added above the header navigation, with  helper. Donna text was removed from the main page. Sample prompts in example cards had quotes removed.
        -   **Notifications**: All notification-related state, functions (, , , ), and  registration calls were removed from the frontend to ensure a clean, bug-free deployment.
        -   **Navigation**: Health and Career tabs were swapped for better UX (Health before Career). The main navigation bar () was made  at the bottom, and  received  to prevent content overlap.
        -   **Chat Display**: Message alignment was changed to traditional chat (user right, AI left) with optimized horizontal space (, reduced padding).
        -   **Thinking State**: The jarring red light for Donna's thinking state was replaced with a static blue orb with no light emission.
-   **/app/frontend/src/App.css**:
    -   **Importance**: Central stylesheet for glassmorphic design and component layouts.
    -   **Changes Made**: Extensive styling for  positioning (). Styles for the login indicator () were added.  was added to  and mobile-specific styles were introduced () to make them smaller and keep them horizontal.  and  had their bulky card styling (background, backdrop-filter, border, box-shadow) removed to make input elements float.  purple border was replaced with enhanced 3D glassmorphic effects (backdrop-filter, box-shadow, border).  circle background was removed, and a subtle glow was added. The send button's purple block and SEND text were replaced with a glowing arrow icon. The  filter was removed to eliminate the blue light emission. Message container styles (, , ) were updated for right/left alignment and increased  (95%) and reduced padding to optimize horizontal space.
-   **/app/frontend/public/sw.js**:
    -   **Importance**: Service Worker for Web Push Notifications.
    -   **Changes Made**: The file was completely removed as part of the notification feature removal.
-   **/app/frontend/src/components/SettingsModal.js**:
    -   **Importance**: Application settings.
    -   **Changes Made**: All notification-related props (, , ) and the entire notification section from the UI were removed.
-   **/app/frontend/src/components/AuthModal.js**:
    -   **Importance**: Displays the authentication interface.
    -   **Changes Made**: Initially expanded for username/password and Google OAuth. The manual signup form was then simplified to email/password only, then completely removed to only retain Google OAuth. Frontend API calls for manual registration were fixed to include the  prefix.

-   **User Authentication - Manual Signup Backend**: The backend for manual username/password (email-only) registration and login was implemented but then removed from the frontend.

<current_work>
The AI engineer was most recently working on a critical bug in the calendar event display. Although events were confirmed to be in the database and the backend API was returning them correctly (HTTP 200 OK), they were not appearing in the frontend's Calendar tab, which consistently showed Clear schedule. Initial debugging revealed incorrect date filtering () in  was hiding older events. After fixing this and temporarily removing all filtering, the core issue was found to be the  function in  calling a malformed URL:  (a double  prefix). This was causing a 404 error, silently preventing events from loading. The last action in the trajectory was applying a fix to remove this double API prefix from the frontend call.
</current_work>

<optional_next_step>
Verify that the calendar events now load and display correctly in the frontend Calendar tab after fixing the double API prefix in the URL.
