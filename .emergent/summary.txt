The previous AI engineer effectively took on the Donna calendar application, moving it from an initial MVP state through several feature additions and critical bug fixes. The work demonstrates a strong iterative development approach, consistently addressing user feedback and design requirements. Key areas of focus included enhancing the core calendar display with new interactive elements (delete/complete icons, monthly view), refining user interaction with the AI assistant (event title trimming, notes prompt, chat flow logic), and resolving numerous UI/UX bugs related to layout, animations, and data consistency. The engineer showed particular tenacity in fixing persistent UI glitches (e.g., card flip animation, title visibility) and ensuring a polished glassmorphic aesthetic was maintained. The introduction of Smart Suggestions marks a significant value addition, showcasing the application's intelligent, proactive capabilities. The process involved deep dives into both frontend (React, Tailwind CSS) and backend (FastAPI, MongoDB) code, with meticulous debugging and testing to ensure functionality and prevent regressions.

<product_requirements>
The Donna application is a futuristic, sleek AI assistant calendar app with a glassmorphic, 3D, minimal yet high-end design, featuring smooth animations. It offers a main chat interface and a Calendar tab for upcoming events.

**Implemented Features & Fixes:**
1.  **Delete & Completion Icons:** Added trash bin and checkmark icons to event cards' front face for instant removal of canceled/completed events, working on both main grid and Today section.
2.  **Event Title Trimming:** Enhanced natural language processing to extract concise event titles (e.g., Meeting from I have a meeting).
3.  **Follow-up Notes Prompt:** After event creation, Donna asks for notes/reminders. User input is added to event description; subsequent messages create new events if not explicitly notes.
4.  **Event Card Design & Interaction Fixes:**
    *   Resolved title placement issues (always visible, top-left, below date/time).
    *   Replaced glitchy card flip animation with a smooth, centered modal popup for event details.
    *   Fixed event names bleeding outside card edges and quick action buttons disappearing.
5.  **Monthly View Calendar Sub-Tab:** Added a Monthly View tab mirroring Donna's aesthetic (glassmorphic, 3D, color coding, modal popups). It's a full-month grid with navigation, mobile-optimized (slim tabs, compact cells, scrollable event indicators), and responsive (fits 600-700px height).
6.  **Chat Flow Bug Fix:** Corrected issue where new event scheduling requests were misinterpreted as notes for previous events. Event creation now takes priority.
7.  **Event Consistency Fix:** Ensured all acknowledged events correctly appear in the calendar tabs, addressing cases where events were created but not displayed.
8.  **Duplicate Events Fix:** Eliminated redundant event creation by removing frontend-side event handling for chat inputs, ensuring only the backend creates events.
9.  **Monthly View Cosmetic Fixes:**
    *   Changed event display from text to colored dots for a cleaner look.
    *   Ensured event modals appear with correct glassmorphic styling immediately, not just on hover.
    *   Synchronized colored dots in Monthly View to match the Upcoming Events tab's color scheme.
    *   Moved All times shown in UTC indicator to the bottom of the page and slightly reduced sub-tab sizes for better mobile UX.
10. **Timezone Awareness Confirmation:** Verified Donna's full timezone awareness for production, clarifying a preview environment override causing IST/UTC confusion.
11. **Smart Suggestions - Overbooked Day:** Implemented a proactive suggestion system for days with 6+ real events. A glassmorphic card suggests rescheduling a flexible event (60-min default, 15-min buffer) with 3-4 free slots (today, tomorrow morning, 48h ahead; different windows for weekdays/weekends). Actions include reschedule (actual event move), cancel, keep. No page reload on reschedule, and correct timezone scheduling.

**Current Work (In Progress):**
*   **Smart Suggestions - Dense Block:** Adding a new suggestion for 3+ real events within any rolling 5-hour span on the day of (6 AM). It's a compact, one-line glassmorphic pill card with a dismiss option, providing a direct, dry assistant-like nudge.

<pending_tasks>
- Implement an undo option for accidental rescheduling of Smart Suggestions.
- Implement telemetry logging for Smart Suggestions (trigger shown, chosen option, action success/failure, latency; log categories only).
- Expose a user setting for  (relaxed or active).
</pending_tasks>

<current_work>
The immediate work is to implement the Dense Block Smart Suggestion for the calendar tab. This suggestion will trigger on the day itself (at 6 AM) if there are 3 or more real events packed within any rolling 5-hour span. Unlike the Overbooked Day suggestion, this one does not involve rescheduling. Instead, it surfaces a single, compact, one-line glassmorphic pill card with a direct, confident, and slightly wry message (e.g., Three back-to-backs? Carry a small snack!). The user can dismiss this suggestion, and it will not reshow once dismissed or once the dense block has passed. The card will be placed under the Today card, before the main event list. Telemetry for this suggestion will involve logging impressions and dismiss clicks only. The AI engineer is currently in the process of modifying the  file to add the detection logic for dense blocks and update the message content.

Now I need to add the dense block detection function and update the message to match the Donna Paulson tone. Let me add the missing function and improve the copy:
